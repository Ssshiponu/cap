## Credit System

- Chat Autopilot uses a **credit-based** model.  
- **1 reply = few credits**, depending on message length and complexity.  
- Extra **1 credit per 100 tokens** is charged when system prompts are long or advanced.

### Buying Credits
You can purchase a credit package from the **Billing** section.  
Currently, we support **mobile banking payments (Bkash, Nagad, Rocket, etc.)**.

---

## Refund Policy

We will **only issue refunds** if:
- The user **was charged but did not receive credits**.  
- Refund requests must be made within **7 days** of the transaction.

No refunds are given for used or partially used credit packages.

## Managing Your AI

- You can **pause or resume** your AI anytime.  
- Change the **system prompt** to customize how your AI responds.  
- If you have multiple pages/channels, each can have its own AI setup.

---

## Tips for Better Results

- Keep your system prompt clear and concise.  
- Avoid conflicting instructions.  
- Use examples to guide your AI’s tone and behavior.

Example:

```
You are a friendly page assistant for an online shop.
Always greet users politely and answer questions about products.
```
