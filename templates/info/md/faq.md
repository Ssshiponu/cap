Chat Autopilot is an AI-based platform that automates chat replies on Messenger (and soon WhatsApp).  
It allows businesses to engage customers automatically using smart, customizable AI responses.

## Credits & Payments

### 4. How does the credit system work?
Each AI reply consumes a small number of credits depending on message length and complexity.  
If your system prompt is long, the bot may charge **1 extra credit per 100 tokens** used.

### 5. How can I buy credits?
You can buy credit packages directly from the **Billing** section.  
Currently supported: **Bkash**, **Nagad**, and **Rocket** mobile banking.

### 6. What happens if I run out of credits?
The AI will temporarily stop replying until you top up your credits.

The Messenger Bot automatically replies to messages sent to your Facebook page using your custom AI prompt.  
You can configure its tone, style, and memory from your dashboard.

### 8. What is the WhatsApp Bot?
The WhatsApp Bot (coming soon) will let you manage and automate WhatsApp chats using the same credit system.

### 9. Can I use multiple bots?
Yes. You can connect multiple pages or accounts and manage them separately in your dashboard.
